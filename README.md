Training and Tests for an Initiate Scrum Developer, inspired by The Jedi Path.

As with the Jedi, 
Scrum developers follow a defined path on their journey to becoming confident and capable programmers, 
efficiently delivering quality software.

There are 4 main defined stages of the path.

- Entry Level Developer (Initiate)
- Associate Developer (Padawan)
- Developer (Jedi Knight)
- Senior Developer (Jedi Master)

This training concentrates on the Initiate and Padawan stages, 
defining knowledge and discipline through a series of tasks and tests, to facilitate a potential Scrum developers growth to the level of Jedi.

## The Three Pillars
The Three Pillars are key to a developers strength.
These pillars exist across all 4 stages of a Scrum developers journey.
As the developer progresses through the stages, the three pillars evolve with greater layers of understanding.

For a Scrum Developer to become successful they must have all three pillars in balance.

### Knowledge
Knowledge and learning are foundation to Scrum developerâ€™s journey.
Only through knowledge can we combat ignorance. 
The life of a Scrum developer should be one of constant learning, constant self-improvement.
Through diligent study, a Scrum developer will broaden their horizons and be able to embrace new facts and ideas.

### Scrum and Agile
A Scrum developer lives by a code of conduct, 
a set of values facilitating them with the correct attitudes to guide and be guided.
##### The 5 Scrum Values
- Courage
- Focus
- Commitment
- Respect
- Openness

A Scrum developer also understands the value of early delivering of solutions, 
accepting feedback and iteratively growing themselves and their solutions.

### Self-Discipline
Self-Discipline is a necessary ingredient to become a Scrum developer.
They do not seek to control others, but instead seek to master themselves.
Without self-discipline a Scrum developer cannot get far in their training.
Part of self-discipline is personal responsibility.
Ultimately you are responsible for your own fate, determined by the decisions you have made in the circumstances you find yourself in.
A Scrum developer does not blame others for shortcomings and failures and uses such setbacks as a learning experience.
A self-disciplined Scrum developer will be industrious, and in control of their emotions.
Having no unnecessary attachments, they can act forthrightly and without fear.
